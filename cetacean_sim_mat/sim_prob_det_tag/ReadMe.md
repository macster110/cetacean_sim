#Example code for tag data. 

This code can be used to run a probability simualtion from some example tag data. 

Download this folder and either add it your MATLAB path or navigate to the downloaded folder in MATLAB.  Run the script run_sim_example and the tag_example.mat file will be laoded and a simualtion run on the data. 

The outputs are two plots, one is the probability density function. The other is the detection function.
