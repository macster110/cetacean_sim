# Example code for tag data. 

This code can be used to run a probability simualtion from some example tag data. 

Download this folder and either add it your MATLAB path or navigate to the downloaded folder in MATLAB.  Run the script _run_sim_example.m_ and the _tag_example.mat_ file will be loaded and a simualtion run on the data. 

The outputs are two plots, one is the probability density function. The other is the detection function.
